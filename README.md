# Modules
There are several modules related to the adsorption processes:
- [1) simsep](https://github.com/sebyga/pyAPEP_v0_0_5#simsep-Module-for-Adsorption-Separation-Processes)
- [2) simsto](https://github.com/sebyga/pyAPEP_v0_0_5#simsto-Module-for-Adsorption-Storage-Processes)
- [3) simide](https://github.com/sebyga/pyAPEP_v0_0_5#simide-Module-Ideal-Adsorption-Processes)

# simsep Module for Adsorption Separation Processes
